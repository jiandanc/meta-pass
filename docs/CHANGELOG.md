# Changelog

## Unreleased

- A child that sleeps on its own idle timeout resumes on a key press (2026-09-24). When a
  slot firmware deep-sleeps after its own idle timeout (60 s, say), a key press is a full
  bootloader start: the slot's otadata copy is still `PENDING_VERIFY`, the rollback logic
  marks it `ABORTED`, neither copy is a candidate, and the bootloader falls back to the
  factory launcher. The child exits instead of resuming. Two changes:

  (1) The bootloader hook now branches on the reset reason. On a deep-sleep wake it renews
  the running child's `PENDING_VERIFY` copy to `VALID` — re-checking the CRC and erasing the
  sector first, since flash programming is one-way — so the bootloader resumes that slot.
  `PENDING_VERIFY` is only ever written by the bootloader when it selects an OTA slot, so
  reading it means "the last boot was a child that has not confirmed itself". A cold reset
  (power loss, watchdog, crash, software restart) still runs the original `VALID`-erase
  policy and still returns to the launcher, so the single-session model is unchanged, and
  the `VALID` this path writes is erased by the next cold boot.

  The launcher-side rewrite is deliberate. IDF's
  `CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_SKIP_VALIDATE_IN_DEEP_SLEEP` was tried first and abandoned on device
  evidence: it records the resume target in `rtc_retain_mem_t` at the top of RTC fast
  memory, which the link script reserves only when `CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_RESERVE_RTC_MEM` is
  set. A child firmware's build does not set it (its RTC timer data covers those 16 bytes),
  so the child overwrites the record as soon as it runs, the CRC check fails, fast boot
  silently falls back to the normal path, and the user still lands in the launcher. Making
  it work would require every child firmware to opt in — exactly the kind of per-child
  cooperation the boot-policy rule forbids. Rewriting otadata has no such dependency.

  (2) The launcher's display init gains deep-sleep wake recovery: it releases the pin holds
  the child left behind (holds survive a reset; unreleased, they swallow every SPI init
  command — a lit backlight over a black screen), and sends `0x11` SLPOUT before the panel
  reset to leave Sleep In (this board's reset pin is not wired to the MCU, and a
  stopped-oscillator panel deadlocks on SWRESET). That second fix covers the path that
  still falls back to the launcher and helps any child that uses deep sleep. New contract
  test `tests/test_display_wake_contract.py` (6 cases) pins the wake-recovery ordering and
  the otadata-resume wiring, wired into `tools/validate.sh --static`.

- Launcher UI simplified to **one-click boot** (2026-09-23): selecting a slot in the main
  list and pressing OK now starts that firmware immediately, signed or unsigned. The slot
  detail page (BOOT / DELETE / BACK), the unsigned-firmware BOOT / CANCEL warning page, and
  the delete-confirmation page are removed, along with their code paths and strings.
  Rationale: the user asked for a shorter path — the second step added nothing for the
  signed case and only a single warning for the unsigned one. Integrity is unchanged:
  `esp_image_verify` still decides whether a slot is bootable, and `meta_sign_verify` still
  runs at boot-time scan (its result is logged, no longer shown or gating). Consequence:
  there is no on-device delete — re-importing over a slot via the web import page replaces
  it. The hidden easter-egg page (fast `UP UP DOWN DOWN`) is re-homed from the detail page
  to the main list and now shows the highlighted slot's egg.

## v1.0.0 (2026-09-18)

First stable release: all four flows — market install, data-preserving
upgrade, slot backup/restore, firmware signing toolchain — are complete;
the four contracts (hybrid single-file MPUPV2, backup manifest v1,
signature format, 3-slot partition layout) are frozen as of this version
(see entries below; the adaptive design keeps future layout tweaks from
breaking existing backups and upgrade paths).

- Boot policy upgraded to **bootloader-enforced (2026-09-18)**: new
  `bootloader_components/meta_boot_hooks/` (IDF hooks mechanism; `bootloader_after_init`
  runs before any application) inspects both otadata copies and erases any whose
  `ota_state == VALID` — a child writing VALID can no longer persist across reboots. The
  boot policy is decided unilaterally by meta-pass, independent of child behavior; devices
  locked by pre-model children self-heal on the next power cycle, no re-flash needed.
  PENDING is untouched (trial-run rollback intact), deep-sleep wake skips everything, and
  intervention is disabled under flash encryption. The policy's pure logic lives in
  `main/meta_boot_policy.h` (host test `tests/test_meta_boot_policy.c` pins the 32-byte
  copy layout and every state decision); QEMU gains case C3: otadata preloaded with the
  harshest resident state (CRC-valid VALID + a real child image in ota_0), asserting both
  copies get erased and the boot falls back to the factory list page.
- Installer backup/restore now carries **NVS automatically (2026-09-18)**: the NVS
  partition (data/nvs subtype, `cardid` excluded) is located from the device's own
  partition table, read automatically during backup and packed as `nvs.bin` (SHA-256 in
  the manifest `nvs` field); restore verifies presence/size/digest and writes it back at
  the target device's located offset (adaptive — no source offset reuse). No user choice
  on either side; an erased NVS is skipped and older zips stay compatible. Rationale: bare
  flashing the single-file image erases NVS at 0x9000 — the backup/restore round-trip is
  the only way app data survives a re-flash. Tests: `test-slot-backup.mjs` PASS 9
  (location rules + manifest compat) and PASS 10 (backup→restore data-path contract with
  tamper negative).
- Single release artifact (build/packaging): `tools/build-firmware.sh` now emits ONE file —
  `meta-pass_v<version>.bin` (~1.1 MB), replacing the three-artifact set (8 MB merged image,
  `meta-pass-bootable_*`, MPUP upgrade container). Format: bootable body (bootloader +
  partition table + phy + app at flash offsets, byte-identical to the merged image head)
  plus a 44-byte `MPUPV2` footer (magic + body length u32le + body SHA-256). Market tools
  flash it raw at 0x0 (ROM boots the body; the footer lands in unused factory tail space);
  the installer's "Upgrade launcher" now accepts this same file — `parseUpgradeArtifact`
  (launcher-upgrade.js) verifies the footer, slices bootloader/table/app out of the body,
  and treats otadata as a generated all-0xFF segment; legacy `MPUPV1` containers stay
  accepted. The 8 MB merged image remains in `build/` for `verify_firmware.py`/QEMU only;
  the verifier rejects stale `bootable_*`/`upgrade` artifacts and enforces footer length /
  body parity. Covered by new PASS 7/8 in `test-launcher-upgrade.mjs` (real-artifact slice
  parity, tamper negatives, legacy compat) and the QEMU harness C1/C2/A2 now boot the
  hybrid file end-to-end (A2 turned from negative to positive — the single file must boot).
- Single-session child boot (launcher): every power-on returns to the launcher list page —
  child firmware no longer persists across reboots. Root cause: the signed child called
  `metapass_mark_valid()` → `esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback()` wrote otadata=VALID
  (flash-persistent), so the bootloader booted the child slot directly on every power-on and
  the launcher never ran; a child that occupies the OK long-press without a return hook would
  lock the device (and a crash-looping child = a true boot loop). Fix, two layers: the hook's
  `metapass_mark_valid()` is now a signature self-diagnostic only (no `cancel_rollback`; ota
  state stays pending → any reboot/power-cycle auto-falls back to factory, crash recovery rides
  the same rollback), and the launcher erases otadata early in `app_main` (`meta_store_mark_factory_valid()`,
  contract updated in `meta_store.h`) maintaining the invariant "launcher ran ⇒ otadata empty ⇒
  next boot defaults to factory". Boundary: a device already held by an old-model resident child
  never reaches the launcher — unlock via that child's return hook (OK long-press) or a re-flash.
  `meta_store.h` comment corrected (`5cbadca`): mark_factory_valid erases otadata, it does not
  mark anything valid. Design docs/README/sdkconfig synced to the single-session contract.
- sign-firmware.sh now accepts the full merged image (bootloader + partition table + app,
  the marketplace flashable format) in addition to bare app images. Root cause fixed:
  the script parsed the bootloader header as the app header (image_len=21024, negative
  `total`, signature at an offset the device never reads -> "unsigned" on device even
  though the command included --egg-text). App location now comes from the single-source
  locator `tools/signing/locate_app_image.py` (factory partition @0x10000, same contract
  as install-slot/extract-app-image.js); merged outputs keep bootloader/partition bytes
  byte-for-byte and append pad + 4 KB metadata sector only; digest covers the app region
  only. test_integration.c gained the same merged-image parsing. Output labels clarified
  (`total` = signed output file size; `sig_offset` now printed slot-relative + absolute).
  Verified on-device-representative host tests: merged + bare inputs both PASS
  (META_SIG_OK + egg parse), structure asserts (head preserved / pad 0xFF / MSIG@offset / MAEG xor).
- Revert pipeline window 32768 -> 64 (stop-and-wait, identical to esptool.py read_flash);
  keep 921600. On-device A/B: esptool.py stop-and-wait @921600 ran 5/5 clean (87 KB/s),
  while the self-built pipeline failed proportionally to throughput at the same baud.
  Mechanism: with pipelining, ACK uplink overlaps the bulk data downlink on the same USB
  CDC endpoint, triggering C3 USB-Serial-JTAG RX loss (log evidence: post-failure drains
  up to 16 s = the stub was sitting on a large backlog of in-flight data). 921600 already
  shrank the per-frame gap from ~300 ms to ~10 ms, so pipelining bought <=15% at high risk.
- Post-hoc retraction of the round-6 investigation doc: the claimed standalone 2-byte
  stub error/status frame does not exist (header + status share one SLIP frame per
  stub_flasher.c; the OK probe and successful full backups disprove a leftover frame).
  Kept: the chunkT0 scope bug (real) and the mock-fidelity methodology lesson. See
  backup-readflash-error-status-frame.md (zh_CN keeps the original as an archive).
- On-device CLI verdict (esptool.py 4.12, 128 KB from slot-0 base): 115200 = 11.4 s,
  921600 = 1.5 s (7.6x); SHA256 identical across both baud rates; 5 consecutive reads
  at 921600 all passed. The high-baud link itself is reliable — backup read failures
  were client-side recovery flaws (now covered by tiered recovery), not the link.
- Tiered read-recovery for backup desync: L1 soft recovery (re-ACK, drain, sync) ->
  L2 reopen the port at the session baud (fixes the hardcoded 115200 reopen that caused
  "5 consecutive failures at the same address": during a 921600 session a 115200 reopen
  yields baud-mismatch garbage) -> L3 full USB-JTAG reset + stub re-upload + baud
  restore (fresh loader instance; no reuse of half-dead state). Every tier logs and
  propagates its own failures — no silent hangs. Round-7 hardening (source-verified against
  `stub_commands.c`): the L1 recovery ACK was 0x8000, which only aborts the stub's
  `handle_flash_read` when `num_acked >= num_sent` — with fewer bytes in flight the stub kept
  streaming the remainder and re-poisoned the line (same-address retry cascades). The recovery
  ACK is now 0xFFFFFFFF (≥ any num_sent → deterministic abort → digest → command loop),
  drain silence 300→800 ms (digest + in-flight residue need a wider window), vendor data-frame
  timeout 8 s→1.5 s (a 4 KB frame is 44 ms at 921600), recovery sync 8 s→1 s, retries 5→8
  (p⁸ ≈ 1e-4 per chunk), i18n retry count follows the constant. Expected effect: transient
  per-chunk failures still appear in the log (device-side, unavoidable) but each costs ~4 s
  instead of ~10 s and no longer cascades into slot-wide abandonment.
- Connect at 921600 baud (8x faster reads). The earlier conclusion that "baudrate is a
  no-op on C3 native USB" was disproved by measurement: debug logs show ~356 ms per 4 KB
  frame, matching 115200-baud wire time. The reason previous baud changes did nothing:
  the page passed baudrate===romBaudrate, so the vendor main() changeBaud branch never
  fired. Now connecting with baudrate=921600/romBaudrate=115200 (standard changeBaud flow),
  with an immediate data-path check and automatic fallback to 115200 on any failure
  (worst case = previous behavior). Read timeout 15s->8s.
- Pipelined backup reads for a large speedup (measured 10.1 KB/s baseline): pinned down the
  `max_in_flight` semantics of the stub's `handle_flash_read` (`stub_commands.c:111`,
  `num_sent - num_acked < max_in_flight` — all three are **bytes**). We passed 64, i.e. 64
  bytes — less than one 4 KB frame, so the stub stopped and waited for an ACK after every
  frame; on top of that, USB-CDC only flushes a trailing partial (<64 B) packet when pushed
  by the next data wave — and in stop-and-wait every frame ends in a 4-byte trailing packet,
  costing ~300 ms per frame. The in-flight window is now
  `globalThis.__READFLASH_PARAMS__ = [4096, 32768]` (byte window = one 32 KB chunk; the stub
  streams 8 frames before waiting); ACKs are still sent per frame (as esptool.py does), with
  cumulative values staying within 0x1000..0x8000 (no 0xC0/0xDB bytes). Covered by a new
  "window bytes semantics" case in `test-readflash-protocol.mjs` (32 KB read must stream 8
  frames with zero ACKs; stop-and-wait mode still supported).
- Fix two transport-layer deadlock defects (observed as: every read session dies at ~2 min,
  and the retry recovery then hangs silently for 30+ minutes with no log):
  ① vendor `readLoop` abandons the in-flight `reader.read()` on timeout; when that
  generator's timeout timer later fires, `finally{buffer=new Uint8Array(0)}` wipes the whole
  transport buffer — any read session outliving `FLASH_READ_TIMEOUT` self-destructs, and
  every `newRead` spawning a fresh generator left stale timers counting. Now: persistent
  `_pendingRead`, explicit generator close, buffer wipe removed; `FLASH_READ_TIMEOUT`
  100s→15s.
  ② vendor `flushInput()` starts with `await this.reader.closed`, which never settles on an
  active serial port — the recovery path hung there forever. Now a bounded cancel
  (cancel + 500ms race); the page-level recovery chain got hard timeouts on every step and
  auto re-opens the serial port when sync fails.
- Add a Debug-mode checkbox to the backup section: logs protocol-level diagnostics (per-chunk
  timing, recovery steps, timeout positions) for remote troubleshooting.
- Fix the root cause of backup read failures ("Packet content transfer stopped" / "No serial
  data received", retries never recovering): the esptool stub appends an unconditional 16-byte
  MD5 digest frame after flash-read data frames (`stub_commands.c`), which esptool-js never
  reads — the leftover frame poisons the next command's response and protocol desync
  accumulates per `readFlash` call. `install-slot/vendor/esptool-js.js` now ACKs per data
  frame and reads/verifies the digest frame (matching `esptool.py read_flash`); new
  `install-slot/vendor/md5.js` provides the digest check; read params pinned to the official
  values (4 KB block — the stub's hard limit — and 64-frame in-flight window). Covered by
  `tools/install-slot/test-readflash-protocol.mjs` (mock-stub protocol test, wired into
  `validate.sh`).
- Add `tools/test-bootable-qemu.mjs`: headless QEMU boot verification — boots build artifacts
  through the passport-sim QEMU WASM core and asserts three things: the UART0 test variant
  completes bootloader → partition table → factory app → app_main; the MPUP upgrade container
  flashed raw at 0x0 indeed fails to boot (negative case, matching real-device behavior); the
  market image (USB-JTAG config) renders non-black ST7789 frames (LVGL display init runs).
  The bootability of the market image `meta-pass-bootable_*.bin` now has automated evidence
  instead of relying on real-device trial flashes.
- Fixed the installer connect flow breaking after a failed connect: the serial port is now released on any connect error (previously a hung or failed connect left the port open and every retry hit "The port is already open"), connects are non-reentrant (`busy`/`connecting` guards), a half-open session no longer clobbers an existing connection (commit to globals happens only after every step succeeds), and a device that silently drops a command no longer hangs the flow forever (15 s probe timeout via `withTimeout`). Removed the pointless `changeBaud()` disconnect/reconnect dance — baud is a no-op on the C3's native USB — and replaced the broken 16 KB read-block probe (the stub's `handle_flash_read` uses a 4 KB stack buffer and **silently returns** for larger blocks) with the officially sanctioned speedup: block size stays at the stub's 4 KB maximum while the in-flight window is raised from 4 KB to 64 blocks × 4 KB = 256 KB, cutting ACK round-trips 64× (mirrors upstream `esptool.py` which already used 4 KB blocks / 64-deep window). Probe verifies bootloader magic + exact length and falls back to conservative 1 KB/4 KB on any mismatch.
- Data-preserving launcher upgrades (§7.2): upgrades write only bootloader + partition table + factory app + an erased-state OTA-data reset; NVS (Wi-Fi credentials), `cardid`, and all three child-firmware slots are never touched. The USB installer gained a "7. Upgrade launcher" section that reads back the device partition table and byte-compares it with the bundle before writing (layout mismatch refuses the upgrade). `tools/build-firmware.sh` now emits a `build/upgrade/` bundle (4 files + `flash-args.txt`), and `tools/verify_firmware.py` enforces that the merged image keeps `nvs`/`ota_0-2`/`otadata` erased so a full image can never carry user-data-destroying content. Core logic in `install-slot/launcher-upgrade.js` with Node tests wired into `tools/validate.sh --static`. The upgrade is distributed as a **single-file MPUP container** (`build/upgrade/meta-pass-upgrade_<version>.bin`: magic + segment table + per-segment SHA-256) — the installer picks this one file, unpacks and verifies it, then writes the four segments to their partition addresses; `verify_firmware.py` additionally enforces container parity with the merged image.
- Slot backup & restore on the USB installer page (`install-slot/`): per-slot backup reads the full partition, slices it into `slot{N}_firmware.bin` (parsed ESP app image) + `slot{N}_tail.bin` (4 KB MSIG/MAEG/MNAM metadata sector) + optional `slot{N}_extra.bin` (post-tail storage), computes SHA-256 per file, and packs everything with a `manifest.json` into a timestamped zip. Restore lets the user map each backed-up slot to any target slot, checks free space against the manifest lengths (adaptive to future slot-size changes), verifies every file's SHA-256 before writing, then flashes firmware → extra → tail (tail last so sector re-erase cannot destroy earlier writes). A slot containing data that is neither erased nor a recognizable app image (e.g. slot 2 doubling as a data-storage partition, littlefs volumes, non-ESP resource packs) is no longer skipped: it gets a dd-style raw mirror fallback — `slot{N}_raw.bin` with trailing erased bytes trimmed, a `type: "raw"` manifest entry, restore written back from the slot base address with only a size ≤ partition and SHA-256 check (no tail-sector reservation). Backup/restore live in their own sections (§5/§6) separate from the install flow; core logic ships in the pure ES module `slot-backup.js` with Node tests wired into `tools/validate.sh --static`. Fixed a `DataView(TypedArray)` compatibility bug in the zip reader (older engines require an ArrayBuffer).
- Signature-verification hardening (`feat/sign` branch): fixed BUG-01/02/04 (uninitialized battery label, inverted `HOST_TEST` egg-magic check with m1–m4 regression tests, `%zu` for `size_t` log), single-source install page (`server.mjs` serves the canonical `install-slot/`; dev-copy drift closed, BUG-03), one-command local build (`tools/build-firmware.sh`), bilingual bug report and root-cause knowledge base (`docs/BUGS.md`, `docs/assets/handoff-unsigned-rootcause.md`, `docs/assets/meta-pass-signing-design.md`, `docs/development/engineering/debugging-workflow.md`). Root cause of the on-device "unsigned" symptom: the stale deployed installer page, not the signing chain; re-flashing through the fixed page restores expected behavior.
- Added the meta-pass multi-firmware launcher (`feature/meta-pass` branch): the partition table keeps the `factory`/`cardid` contract in place while adding `otadata` and three OTA slots of differing sizes (`ota_0@0x180000` / `0x1D6000`, `ota_1@0x360000` / `0x200000`, `ota_2@0x560000` / `0x29E000`); app rollback is enabled (un-adapted child firmware automatically falls back to the launcher on any reboot); firmware import over Wi-Fi SoftAP + web page (random password + on-screen one-time pairing code, streamed in 1024-byte chunks); mandatory image integrity checks (magic/chip-id/size/SHA-256 display, with `esp_ota_end()` as the authoritative re-check) and a warning page with a BOOT / CANCEL menu before booting unsigned firmware; local management UI to list/boot/delete slot firmware; the button BSP exposes an explicit `BSP_BTN_LONG` (1.5 s) threshold; pure-logic modules (image validation, slot registry, import state machine) ship with host tests wired into the static gate. Design: `docs/assets/meta-pass-design.md`.
- Second import channel (USB serial, `tools/install-slot/`): Chrome + Web Serial +
  esptool-js write child firmware directly into a slot while the device is in ROM
  download mode (power on while holding UP); sources are a local `.bin` (Full Flash
  images are unpacked to their app image) or a community play link (verified against
  the published SHA-256). Design: `docs/assets/meta-pass-design.md` §6.1.
- Slot display-name blob (§6.2): the real firmware name is written at install time
  into the slot partition's last 4KB sector (`slot_offset + partition_size − 4KB`,
  derived per slot because the three slot sizes now differ: `0x1D6000`/`0x200000`/
  `0x29E000`; `magic "MNAM"` + length + printable ASCII + XOR checksum, ≤32 bytes);
  the launcher scan prefers it and falls back to the core name (`project_name` minus
  the `FoloToy-` prefix, new `meta_slot_core_name`). `ota_2` is a dual-use area
  (bootable child slot, or littlefs recording storage when empty). The factory
  app limit tightens to 1.44 MB (`0x170000`) with `ota_0` moved into the
  cardid-before gap (`0x180000`). The USB install page auto-fills the community
  play's English title / local file name; the Wi-Fi import page gained an optional
  name field.

- Added the supplied 80-byte CW2017 profile for the specified 520 mAh cell, including content/update-flag checks, verified writes, the required restart sequence, and bounded SOC-readiness polling.

- Expanded the environment bootstrap document: added Espressif's Git service mirror (`git.espressif.com.cn`) as the preferred mainland-China route for ESP-IDF v5.5.3 and its submodules, documented submodule long-wait/timeout handling, in-place repair, and the pinned-commit shallow fetch for large submodules such as `esp32-wifi-lib`, warned about stale per-repository Jihulab `insteadOf` residue, and added the official offline release archive as a last-resort fallback (learned from `esp-mosaico/esp-mosaico-vibe`).

- Reorganized the documentation by function area with a dual entry point: the root `AGENTS.md` is now a thin router (hard constraints + task routing only) and the detailed AI workflow lives in `docs/development/ai-guide.md`; `agent-guide.md` was folded in. `docs/development/` gained a second level (`engineering/`, `ci/`, `release/`), and the `plays/` application archive and `experiences/` moved into a `docs/reference/` area with a dedicated README. Removed `docs/software-design/` (empty scaffold); folded the three `assets/{fonts,images,music}/README` leaves into the `assets/` README; flattened the six `project-completion` sub-documents into a single file; and unified each directory to a single README, eliminating every `INDEX` file and a duplicated experience index. All cross-references and bibliographic links were updated; no content was dropped.

- Removed the obsolete app/test partition at `0x700000` and its related
  bootloader, validation, and documentation requirements. The fixed protected
  `cardid` partition and its CI checks remain unchanged.
- Documented a release-title convention for multi-app releases: name tags as `v<version>-<app-name>` (e.g. `v0.1.0-voice-keychain`) so the release title carries the version and the app, and confirm the title after the release is published so a release list is scannable by app.
- Added a post-release follow-up workflow: an `issue-suggestions` skill for filing user feedback as issues against the upstream project, an `experience-pr` skill for submitting reusable development experience as a documentation PR, a `docs/experiences/` directory for per-entry experience files, and supporting `project-completion`, `file-issues`, and experience-index documents.
- Simplified the tracked repository root: moved GitHub-recognized community documents into `.github/`, moved the changelog into `docs/`, updated every reference, and added a root-document allowlist to repository checks.
- Repository-wide language policy: every maintained Markdown default `.md` file is English, Simplified Chinese uses a paired `.zh_CN.md`, and both provide language switches. Static checks reject missing peers, missing switches, and Chinese prose in English defaults.
- Phase one of the AI development workflow: streamlined task-based context routing, unified local/CI validation, added PR checks and a template, and committed the dependency lock for reproducible builds.
- PR review fixes: pinned GitHub Actions to full commit SHAs, split build/release jobs by least privilege, disabled persisted sync checkout credentials, added Feature Request and Usage Question forms, clarified private security-report fallback, and corrected stale README, CI-trigger, and branch descriptions.
- Changed commit titles, PR titles, and PR bodies from Chinese-default to English; updated the Chinese punctuation rule so it no longer applies to PR descriptions.
- Reworked `build-firmware.yml` to pass `SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults`, enable `partitions.csv`, preserve the 8 MB image header, merge a flashable `FoloToy-AI-Passport-full.bin`, publish only that artifact, and use Actions cache v5.
- Integrated upstream PR #6 to resolve PR #4 conflicts: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE, radio lifecycle, and low-power demos; a 3 MB factory partition; build/menu/configuration updates; hardware-guide coverage; and bilingual capability tables.
- Defined English imperative Conventional Commit formatting for both commits and PR titles.
- Removed stale sync-workflow template comments and generalized an irrelevant Redis TTL rule to cache components.
- Added Chinese punctuation, credential safety, and recoverable file-deletion conventions.
- Expanded source-comment requirements for functions, state, ownership, concurrency, timing, registers, and magic values.
- Removed AI execution instructions from product READMEs so they remain human-facing product and repository overviews.
- Added `docs/development/agent-guide.md` as the focused AI workflow guide.
- Updated `AGENTS.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, and the development index for the agent guide.
- Documented why the root README path is reserved for fork owners and how GitHub README precedence supports it.
- Created `main-update` from the upstream-aligned baseline and combined the repository-structure, firmware-CI, and upstream-sync work.
- Corrected the merged documentation index, workflow path, project tree, and CI references.
- Moved CI documentation from software design to `docs/development/`.
- Moved fork-only documentation assets from `assets/docs/` to `docs/assets/`.
- Moved the upstream English/Chinese project READMEs under `docs/` and renamed the documentation catalog to `docs/INDEX.md`.
- Initialized `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Standardized the initial project README language filenames.
- Added the `docs/`, `assets/`, and `skills/` directory structure.
- Moved the upstream hardware guide into `docs/hardware-design/`.
- Standardized subdirectory README capitalization and introduced fork conventions.
- Allowed fork-owned root README and supplemental documentation content on fork `main`.
- Added and documented the fork-only supplemental-document directory.
- Moved the build CI document to its dedicated CI branch before consolidation.
- Documented clean-`main` reasons, the direct-development exception, and Actions enablement for forks.
- Split the original agent rules into contribution, development, and fork documents with a compact root index.
- Updated software-design and project README references for the new documentation structure.
- Added the documentation catalog and task-triggered routing based on the earlier repository model.
- Added bilingual contribution, code-of-conduct, security, and support documents tailored to this ESP-IDF and fork workflow.
